        <p class="p1">Hello, my name is Roland. I'm originally from Tucson, AZ, but I currently reside in Gilbert, AZ. I've been
            here for almost two years, and it's very different being in the huge Phoenix metropolitan area compared to
            the spread out small town vibe of Tucson.</p>

        <p class="p2">Lately my weeks are consumed by working full time for Nabisco and attending a coding bootcamp through the
            University of
            Arizona. At Nabisco, I work as an order writer and merchandiser. After being there for about six years, it's
            time for a change, hence the coding bootcamp, which I'm enjoying so far.</p>

        <p class="p3">In my limited free time, I usually enjoy hanging out with my friends or catching up on sleep, but not at the
            same time. Outside of that, my hobbies include playing guitar and going to as many concerts as possible. I've
            been playing guitar since I was 14 years old, and I try to attend one concert a month.</p>
